This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving the `useEffect` hook and its dependencies. The `MyComponent` initially sets `count` to 1 only if `props.name` is 'Initial'.  However, if `props.name` changes later, `count` doesn't update because the effect only runs once. The solution shows the correct way to handle prop changes within useEffect to ensure the effect runs whenever the prop value changes.
